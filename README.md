6. 
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What c
1. Avoids project delays
2. Ensures resource optimization
3. It maximizes profitability by ensuring not exceeding the allocated budget.
4. Ensures project completion without experiencing financial constraints.
5. Mantains stakeholders confidence by building trust that the team can manage their budgets effectively.

Strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?   
Advantages
a)Agile
   1. Adaptable to any changing requirements.
   2. Continuous feedback helps improve the quality.
   3. Early bug detection.

b)Waterfall
1. Easier cost estimation and planning.
2. There is a clear structure and well documented process.
3. Ideal for large-scale projects.
4. Works well for projects with fixed requirements.

Disdvantages
a)Agile
1. Difficult to estimate timelines and costs.
2. Requires strong collaboration and discipline.
3. Less emphasis on documentation.
4. Not ideal for strict regulatory environments

b)Waterfall
1. Changes are costly.
2. Late testing may uncover major issues.
3. Clients are able to see final product late in development.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

1. Waterfall is high risk as failures arrive late while Agile has lower risks since there is continuos feedback and changes.
2. Waterfall is highly rigid in making changes while Agile is flexible and allows continuos changes.
3. Waterfall's process is linear while Agile's is iterative.
4. Testing for Waterfall is done after development whilst Agile done continuously throughout the development stage.
5. For Waterfall, customer's is engaged in planning stage and after delivery while for Agile customer is engaged continuosly in development.
Scenarios for Waterfall: government projects, infrastructure projects, banking system upgrade
Scenarios for Agile: Mobile Apps,e-commerce sites, games development
